Issues 1:

âœ… What I did:(ANGEL AS A DATA analyst)
cloned the data template repo â†’ it created a separate Git repo.

Thatâ€™s why I couldn't commit your changes to your group project repo â€” because they were 2 separate Git repos.

After deleting that cloned template, i AM free again inside your group project repo.

Now i can safely copy-paste the template files into OUR group repo folder â†’ stage â†’ commit â†’ push â€” everything works âœ…

âœ… What i learned :

We can't clone two repos inside the same project folder.
If we do, it creates two separate .git folders , which causes conflicts when trying to commit changes.

It's better to clone only your main group repo, and copy template files manually into it when needed.

ðŸ”‘ Golden Rule (bootcamp Git survival tip):
Only one .git folder per project.

Clone only the group repo.

For templates or external files â†’ just copy-paste, not clone.
